# 1. For Loop

for i in range(5):
    print(i)

# 2. While Loop

counter = 0

while counter < 5:
    print("counter value is", counter)
    counter += 1


# Prectice Quation #

# 1. Use a for loop to print the numbers from 1 to 10.

# for i in range(10):
#     print(i+1)

# 2. Use a while loop to count form 10 down to 1.

# counter = 10

# while counter >= 1:
#     print(counter)
#     counter -= 1
